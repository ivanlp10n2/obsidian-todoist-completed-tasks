# Todoist Completed Tasks - Obsidian Plugin
#### forked to do my things, donations are for they

### üìã current todolist :
- [ ] feat: test serialization and document jsons in code
- feat: refactor tested code
- [ ] res: define what's the best way to handle data for dataview
    - I will have to `upsert` notes for each task
    - I will create folders for each day
        - todoist-sync/YYYY/MM/DD/task-title.md
        - I would create folders based on `dueAt`
            - update `status` based on `completedAt`
    - with metadata:
        - status: inprogress | completed
        - section: section-name
        - project: project-name
        - createdAt: YYYY-MM-DD:HH:MM:SS
        - dueAt: YYYY-MM-DD:HH:MM:SS
        - completedAt: YYYY-MM-DD:HH:MM:SS
        - priority: 1
        - tags: #todoist #sync #labels
    - and data structure:
        - description
        - sub-tasks
            - link to `todoist-sync/YYYY/MM/DD/task-title/sub-task-title.md`
        - comments
            - link to `todoist-sync/YYYY/MM/DD/task-title/comments.md`
- [ ] res: define how can I save it into a particular path
    - [ ] res: how can I create files in there or put at the end if the already exists
- [ ] tech: add new values to test
- [ ] implement solution. can be a new serialization impl
    - [ ] deserialize
    - [ ] save in folder with upsert strategy
    - [ ] paste script only (depends on how do we handle data) 
- [ ] test all other important functions to start refactoring
- convention in code would be: 
    - `startLowerCamelCase` for variable and class names
    - `StartUpperCamelCase` for constants
    - `snake_case` for json and object fields becase todoist also uses it
    - `kebab-case` for filenames and folders

## how to run it as dev
-  `npm install`
-  `npm run build`
    - this should create `main.js` 
- copy `main.js` to `<vault>/plugins/todoist-completed-tasks/main.js`
- `npm run build && cp main.js ~/Obsidian\ Notebook/personal/.obsidian/plugins/todoist-completed-tasks-plugin/main.js`
- disable and enable the plugin to reload it

## how to test it
- add __mocks__ folder to the root of the project
- `npm install --save-dev ts-jest @types/jest`
- `npm test`
