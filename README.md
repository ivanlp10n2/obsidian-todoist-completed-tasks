# Todoist Completed Tasks - Obsidian Plugin
#### forked to do my things, donations are for they

---

### 📋 current todolist :
- [x] feat: test serialization and document jsons in code
    - at least `fetchTasks` and `formatTasks`
- [x] feat: refactor tested code
- [x] res: define what's the best way to handle data for dataview
    - ✅I will have to `upsert` notes for each task
    - ✅I will create folders for each day
        - ✅todoist-sync/YYYY/MM/DD/task-title.md
        - ✅I would create folders based on `dueAt`
            -✅ update `status` based on `completedAt`
    - with metadata:
        - ✅status: inprogress | completed
        - section: section-name
        - ✅project: project-name
        - ✅createdAt: YYYY-MM-DD:HH:MM:SS
        - ✅dueAt: YYYY-MM-DD:HH:MM:SS
        - ✅completedAt: YYYY-MM-DD:HH:MM:SS
        - priority: 1
        - ✅tags: #todoist #sync #labels
    - and data structure:
        - ✅description
        - sub-tasks
            - link to `todoist-sync/YYYY/MM/DD/task-title/sub-task-title.md`
        - comments
            - link to `todoist-sync/YYYY/MM/DD/task-title/comments.md`
- [x] res: define how can I save it into a particular path
    - [x] res: how can I create files in there or put at the end if the already exists
        - no update. all or none ✅
- [x] ✅ tech: add new values to test
- [x] ✅ implement solution. can be a new serialization impl
    - [x] deserialize
    - [x] save in folder with upsert strategy
    - [x] paste script only (depends on how do we handle data) 
- [x] ✅ test all other important functions to start refactoring
- [x] ✅ convention in code would be: 
    - `startLowerCamelCase` for variable and class names
    - `StartUpperCamelCase` for constants
    - `snake_case` for json and object fields becase todoist also uses it
    - `kebab-case` for filenames and folders

- for obsidian tags I will start with `todoist_` and then the tag name
```yaml
---
date: ${todoist_completed_at}$
todoist_created_at: str
todoist_updated_at: str | null
todoist_completed_at: str | null
todoist_task_id: str | null
todoist_project_name: str | null
todoist_project_id: str | null
todoist_parent_id: str | null
todoist_status: done | inprogress | todo
todoist_is_recurring: boolean
todoist_lables: str[]
tags: [todoist, project_name, status]
---
```

## how to run it as dev
-  `npm install`
-  `npm run build`
    - this should create `main.js` 
- copy `main.js` to `<vault>/plugins/todoist-completed-tasks/main.js`
- `npm run build && cp main.js ~/Obsidian\ Notebook/personal/.obsidian/plugins/todoist-completed-tasks-plugin/main.js`
- disable and enable the plugin to reload it

## how to test it
- add __mocks__ folder to the root of the project
- `npm install --save-dev ts-jest @types/jest`
- `npm test`

---

## Project structure that I'll go for components
```
src/constants/: stateless - all inside this folder. Should not have side effect with no dependencies. reusable in tests
src/constants/{component_name}.ts: stateless - types and constants of the component for test re-usability
src/constants/shared.ts: shared constants - for now rule is: if types are used in two different files it will be explicit in the imports. candidate for domain boundaries research. 
src/{component_name}.ts: main component with dependencies and business logic
src/{component_name}/{sub_component_name}.ts: sub component if too complex or easier to think in parts
src/{component_name}.test.ts: tests
```

I don't know what the domain is. I'll just go for the components and then see if it's clearer as I move forward.
### how do i think it
- if it's a shared logic between one file:
    - refactor it to a function
    - if it has side-effects or it's stateful -> it goes into the file or class `components/file-name.ts`
    - if is a pure function -> it goes into `constants/file-name.ts`
- if it's a shared logic between two files:
    - refactor it to a function
    - if it has side-effects or is stateful -> it goes into the file or class
    - if is a pure function -> it goes into constants/s.ts
